## Written by [Rachel Donahue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelmdonahue/)

### Assumptions

### Limitations

## Coding Exercise Instructions

- Use React, Express, and your favorite relational database.
- Write an app that allows you to see the current price of a stock, create a fake buy or sell order, and store it in a database.
- Show the past orders in the front end.
- No authentication or hosting.
- Assume a single user of this app for past activity.
- Be able to look up current prices for a given stock symbol.
- If you can deliver us a Github repo that'll do fine. No deployed URL is needed.
- Time limit: no more than 6h.
